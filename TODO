================================================================================
# JHA TODO get logging working with verbose flag

* make filenames and directories options once we get pyres class

* way to see how long each episode is - and how much time is being downloaded - maybe how much time in each state

* Create a top level function to prompt for what's been listened to on mp3
  player, deleted and mark it as heard in database

* get the set of bat files for testing/using the tool straightened out

# add way to pull a small number of podcasts at a time from long-established podcasts (i.e. only have x number of episodes in play at once)
