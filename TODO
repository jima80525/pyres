================================================================================
Todo list for pyres project, in no particular order at this point
================================================================================
* way to see how long each episode is - and how much time is being downloaded -
  maybe how much time in each state

* make filenames and directories options once we get pyres class
* option to specify mp3 player location
* option to specify database location

* make update the default action - maybe add subcommands?

* move top level functionality out of the rss class and into a new pyres class

* Create a top level function to prompt for what's been listened to on mp3
  player, deleted and mark it as heard in database

* get the set of bat files for testing/using the tool straightened out

* add way to pull a small number of podcasts at a time from long-established
  podcasts (i.e. only have x number of episodes in play at once)

* add audiobook queue

* figure out how to mock for unit tests

* GUI!
