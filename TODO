Todo list for Pyres

*  explore how to refactor top level to make unit tests less obnoxious
*
*  Convert database access to peewee
*  https://peewee.readthedocs.org/en/latest/peewee/installation.html
*
*  Update docs - look into sphinx and how it works

Features to be added:
* tracking and removing items from MP3 player
* managing a queue of audiobooks (filling player when possible)
* tests need to be expanded to cover more of the top level functions
* combine process and update commands
* Test filemanager path conversions on windows
* way to see how long each episode is - and how much time is being downloaded -
  maybe how much time in each state
* GUI

# this needs to get added to the download code when we're pulling down files
from slugify import slugify
    # create the directory for the stored files
    podcast_name = slugify(podcast_name)
    podcast_path_name = base_dir / podcast_name
    podcast_path_name.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
