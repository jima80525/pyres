================================================================================
* make update the default action - maybe add subcommands?
* Clean up cli output for mp3 player download command
* option to specify mp3 player location
* way to see how long each episode is - and how much time is being downloaded - maybe how much time in each state
* move top level functionality out of the rss class and into a new pyres class
* Create a top level function to prompt for what's been listened to on mp3
  player, deleted and mark it as heard in database
* get the set of bat files for testing/using the tool straightened out

* MP3 player download always runs - doesn't check state right
